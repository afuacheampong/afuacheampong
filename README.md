# Welcome! 
Hi, I’m Afua (ey-fwah) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aemmadi/aemmadi/master/wave.gif" width="35px" /> 
</div>

I’m a software engineer focused on building **reliable, secure, and automated systems**.
I design and ship backend services, cloud infrastructure, and internal tooling with a strong emphasis on production readiness, security, and developer experience.
This GitHub documents my hands-on work as I build real-world systems end to end.

#### Feel free to message me to say hello, or to work on something together!
